# 1.4 Integration Libraries

We can provide a range of libraries to help you to integrate with the Gateway. 

These libraries include simple server-side classes in many popular programming languages, through to client-side scripts to help with the integration of the Hosted Payment Page or Hosted Payment Fields. 

For more information about these libraries, please refer to appendix 23.7A-20
