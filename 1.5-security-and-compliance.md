# 1.5 Security and Compliance

Each method requires a different level of server security and compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard \(PCI DSS\).

If you use Hosted Payment Pages with the Hosted Integration or Hosted Payment Fields with the Direct or Batch Integrations, then your webserver does not need an SSL certificate and you require the lowest level of PCI DSS compliance.

If your website collects and/or stores sensitive Cardholder data, such as the card number \(PAN\) or card security code \(CVV/CV2\), then your webserver must have an SSL certificate and serve all payment forms using HTTPS. You will also need a higher level of PCI DSS compliance and to complete a PCI validation form annually.
