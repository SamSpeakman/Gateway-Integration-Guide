# 1.3 Integration methods

There are three methods of integration provided to process your transactions through the Gateway, allowing for different levels of control and communication from your website.

### 1.3.1 Hosted Integration

The Hosted Integration method makes it easy to add secure payment processing to your ecommerce business, using our Hosted Payment Pages \(HPP\). You can use this method if you do not want to collect and store Cardholder data.

The Hosted Integration method works by redirecting the Customer to our Gateway’s Hosted Payment Page, which will collect the Customer’s payment details and process the payment before redirecting the Customer back to a page on your website, letting you know the payment outcome. This allows you the quickest path to integrating with the Gateway.

The standard Hosted Payment Page is designed to be shown in a lightbox over your website and styled with logos and colours to match. Alternatively, you can arrange for fully customised Hosted Payment Pages to be produced that can match your website’s style and layout. These fully customised pages are usually provided using a browser redirect, displaying full-page in the browser, or can be displayed embedded in an iframe on your website.

For greater control over the customisation of the payment page, our Gateway offers the use of Hosted Payment Fields, where only the individual input fields collecting the sensitive Cardholder data are hosted by the Gateway while the remainder of the payment form is provided by your website. These Hosted Payment Fields fit seamlessly into your payment page and can be styled to match your payment fields. When your payment form is submitted to your server, the Gateway will submit a payment token representing the sensitive card data it collected and your webserver can then use the Direct Integration to process the payment without ever being in contact with the collected Cardholder data. For more information please refer to our Hosted Payment Fields SDK Guide.



## 1.3.2 Direct integration

The Direct Integration works by allowing you to keep the Customer on your system throughout the checkout process, collecting the Customer’s payment details on your own secure server before sending the collected data to our Gateway for processing. This allows you to provide a smoother, more complete checkout process to the Customer.

In addition to basic sales processing, the Direct Integration can be used to perform other actions such as refunds and cancellations, which can provide a more advanced integration with our Gateway.

## **1.3.3 Batch Integration** 

The Batch Integration is an enhancement to the Direct Integration, allowing you to send multiple transactions in a single request and monitor their status. This is useful if you wish to capture multiple transactions or collect multiple payments – for example, collecting subscription charges or loan repayments. In addition to basic sales processing, the Batch Integration can be used to perform other actions, such as refunds and cancellations, which can provide a more advanced integration with our Gateway. Unlike the Hosted and Direct Integrations, the Batch Integration does not process transactions sent to it immediately. Instead, the Gateway queues these transactions to be processed and returns a batch reference number which can be used to download a file that contains the current status of the transactions. Batch Processing does not support transactions that require Customer interaction such as 3D Secure transactions, or alternative payment methods with interactive Wallet or Checkout pages.
